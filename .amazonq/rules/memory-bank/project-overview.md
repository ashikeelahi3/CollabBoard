# CollabBoard - Real-Time Kanban Project Management

## Project Overview
CollabBoard is a full-stack real-time Kanban board application similar to Trello/Asana, designed to demonstrate advanced full-stack development skills including real-time communication, complex state management, and sophisticated database relationships.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple users can work simultaneously with instant updates
- **Intuitive drag-and-drop**: Native HTML5 API implementation without external libraries
- **Role-based permissions**: Granular access control for different user types
- **Scalable architecture**: Modular design supporting growth and feature expansion

## Key Technical Challenges Solved
1. **Real-time state synchronization** across multiple clients
2. **Complex nested data relationships** (Users → Boards → Columns → Cards)
3. **Concurrent user interactions** with conflict resolution
4. **Native drag-and-drop implementation** without libraries
5. **Role-based access control** with secure authorization

## Success Metrics
- Sub-100ms real-time update latency
- Support for 50+ concurrent users per board
- Zero data loss during concurrent operations
- 99.9% uptime for real-time features
